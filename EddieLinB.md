## About the Dataset

**Dataset:** Heart Disease UCI (Combined)  
**Source:** UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle  
**File:** `heart_disease_uci.csv`  
**Target Variable:** `num` (diagnosis of heart disease: 0 = no disease, 1-4 = presence of disease)

### Clinical Context

Heart disease remains the leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 17.9 million deaths annually according to the World Health Organization. This dataset combines patient records from four medical institutions: Cleveland Clinic, Hungarian Institute of Cardiology, University Hospital Zurich (Switzerland), and VA Long Beach Medical Center. Understanding these diagnostic variables is crucial for:

- Early identification of high-risk patients
- Understanding regional variations in heart disease presentation
- Clinical decision support systems
- Risk stratification and preventive care planning

---

## Getting Started

First, load the dataset and import your libraries:

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Load the dataset
#Prints first 5 rows of our dataset
df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease_uci.csv')
# Display first few rows to confirm it loaded
#Prints first 5 rows of our dataset
df = pd.read_csv('heart_disease_uci.csv')

df.head(5)
```

### Clinical Research Questions for Version B

Answer these questions based on your research (you may need to use Google):

**1. What is hypertension? According to current American Heart Association guidelines, what are the blood pressure thresholds for normal, elevated, Stage 1 hypertension, and Stage 2 hypertension?**

Your answer:

---

**2. What is resting ECG (restecg)? What do "normal," "ST-T abnormality," and "left ventricular hypertrophy" findings indicate about heart health?**

Your answer:

---

**3. What is fasting blood sugar (fbs)? Why is the threshold of 120 mg/dl clinically significant? What does elevated fasting blood sugar indicate about diabetes risk?**

Your answer:

---

**4. What does the number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy (ca) tell us? Why might having more blocked vessels indicate worse heart disease?**

Your answer:

---

## Part 3: Data Validation (15 points)

### 3.1 Blood Pressure Validation (5 points)

Write code to check:
- How many blood pressure readings are 0? (This is clinically impossible for a living patient!)
- How many readings are below 80 mmHg? Above 200 mmHg?
- What might a value of 0 represent in this dataset?

**Your Code:**
```python

```

**Your Findings:**

- Are there any impossible blood pressure values?

- How should values of 0 be treated - as missing data or as valid values?

- Does this match what `.isnull()` reports for this column?

---

### 3.2 Cholesterol Validation (5 points)

Write code to examine cholesterol values closely. Check for any unusual values including zeros.

**Your Code:**
```python

```

**Your Findings:**

- Did you find any cholesterol values of 0?

- Is a cholesterol level of 0 clinically possible?

- How many such impossible values exist?

- What would happen if you calculated the mean cholesterol without handling this?

---

### 3.3 Multi-Source Data Validation (5 points)

This dataset combines data from four different medical centers. Write code to:
1. Count patients from each source (dataset column)
2. Check if missing data patterns differ by source

**Your Code:**
```python

```

**Your Findings:**

- Which medical center contributed the most patients?

- Which medical center contributed the fewest?

- Do certain columns have more missing data in certain sources? Which ones?

- Why might data completeness vary across medical institutions?

---

## Part 4: Create Clinical Blood Pressure Groups (10 points)

Create a new column called `bp_category` that categorizes patients based on their resting blood pressure according to American Heart Association guidelines.

### Version B: Blood Pressure Categories

Use these categories based on AHA hypertension guidelines:

| BP Category | Systolic Range (trestbps) | Clinical Significance |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Missing/Invalid | 0 or NaN | Data quality issue - cannot classify |
| Normal | < 120 | Healthy blood pressure |
| Elevated | 120-129 | At risk for hypertension |
| Stage 1 HTN | 130-139 | Hypertension Stage 1 |
| Stage 2 HTN | ≥ 140 | Hypertension Stage 2 - requires treatment |

**Note:** HTN = Hypertension. Real BP classification uses both systolic AND diastolic, but we only have systolic (trestbps) in this dataset.

### Your Code:

```python
# Create the bp_category column
# IMPORTANT: You must handle values of 0 appropriately - they should be "Missing/Invalid"
# You can use a custom function with .apply() OR pd.cut()


```

### Verify your groupings worked:

```python
# Show counts per BP category

```

### Calculate heart disease rate by blood pressure category:

```python
# Create a binary indicator for heart disease (num > 0 means disease present)
# Then calculate the percentage of patients with heart disease in each BP category
# Exclude the "Missing/Invalid" category from your interpretation

```

### Analysis Questions:

**1. How many patients are in each blood pressure category? How many have missing/invalid blood pressure readings?**

Your answer:

---

**2. What is the heart disease rate (percentage) for each blood pressure category (excluding invalid)?**

Your answer:

---

**3. Does heart disease prevalence increase with blood pressure as expected? What does this suggest about the relationship between hypertension and heart disease?**

Your answer:

---

## Part 5: Research Questions (15 points)

### 5.1 Write Three Answerable Questions (9 points)

Write three questions that THIS dataset can answer. Remember: the data can show relationships and patterns, but cannot prove causation.

**Your questions must explore these specific areas:**

1. **A question about resting ECG results (restecg) and heart disease:**


---

2. **A question comparing the four medical centers (dataset):**


---

3. **A question about the combination of diabetes indicator (fbs) AND exercise-induced angina (exang):**


---

### 5.2 Identify One Question the Data CANNOT Answer (3 points)

Write one question about **patient lifestyle or family history** that this dataset cannot answer, and explain why.

**Question:**


**Why it cannot be answered with this data:**


---

### 5.3 Grouping Analysis (3 points)

Answer this question using a groupby analysis:

**"What is the average cholesterol level (chol) for patients with vs. without heart disease?"**

(Note: You'll need to create a binary heart disease indicator and handle cholesterol values of 0!)

**Your Code:**
```python

```

**Your Interpretation:**

Do patients with heart disease have higher average cholesterol than those without? Is the difference what you expected? What might confound this simple comparison?


---

## Part 6: Target Variable Analysis (Bonus - 5 points)

The `num` column is our **target variable** - what we're trying to predict. It has 5 possible values (0-4) representing the severity of heart disease narrowing. Analyze its distribution.

**Your Code:**
```python
# Show the count and percentage for each value of num

# Also create a binary version (0 = no disease, 1 = disease present) and show its distribution

```

### Bonus Questions:

**1. What percentage of patients in this dataset have some form of heart disease (num > 0)?**

Your answer:

---

**2. Is this dataset balanced or imbalanced between disease/no disease?**

Your answer:

---

**3. Looking at the 5 severity levels (0-4), which level is most common? Is this distribution what you'd expect clinically?**

Your answer:

---

**4. How might the multi-severity nature of the target (0-4) versus a simple binary (disease/no disease) affect how you'd approach a machine learning problem?**

Your answer:

---

## Hints (Read Before You Get Stuck!)

### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls:

1. **Values of 0 that aren't really zero**
   - Some columns (like `trestbps` and `chol`) have 0 values that represent missing data, not actual measurements
   - The `.isnull()` method won't detect these!
   - Always examine your data with `value_counts()` and check if extreme values make clinical sense

2. **Missing data varies by source**
   - The four medical centers have different data completeness
   - Some columns like `ca`, `thal`, and `slope` have extensive missing data
   - Understanding WHY data is missing is as important as knowing that it's missing

3. **The target variable has multiple levels**
   - `num` ranges from 0-4, not just 0-1
   - For many analyses, you'll want to convert this to binary (disease present/absent)

4. **Sex is coded as text**
   - Unlike some versions of this dataset, sex is "Male"/"Female" not 0/1

### 💡 Pro Tips:

- Use `value_counts(dropna=False)` to see if there are any null values
- When something seems weird (like 0 blood pressure), investigate it—don't assume it's valid
- Cross-reference columns: do the patterns make clinical sense together?
- Read the original UCI documentation for additional context
- Always state what the data CAN tell you vs. what would require additional information
